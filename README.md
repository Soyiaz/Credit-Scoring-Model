# Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative Data

This project introduces a **credit risk assessment tool** that leverages **alternative data** (e.g., telecom usage, transaction patterns) to support smarter lending decisions. Built for financial institutions, it showcases how data science can enhance **risk evaluation** while remaining **transparent, auditable, and compliant** with regulatory standards.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Traditional credit scoring overlooks individuals lacking formal credit histories. This solution enables financial providers to:

- **Widen credit access** using non-traditional data sources.  
- **Ensure transparency** in risk evaluation to meet Basel II-style compliance.  
- **Optimize predictive power and explainability** to build trust and usability.  

---

## 💡 Business Value

- **Smarter credit portfolio management** by identifying high-risk applicants early.  
- **Lower default rates** through more accurate risk predictions than rule-based systems.  
- **Promote financial inclusion** by evaluating underbanked individuals.

## 🛠️ Key Components

### Risk Modeling

- **Logistic Regression**: Clear, interpretable, and compliance-friendly.  
- **Random Forest**: Stronger predictive performance with model explainability.  

### Interpretability

- **SHAP-based insights**: Understand and visualize model decisions.  

### Interactive Interfaces

- **REST API** via FastAPI for seamless integration.  
- **Planned Streamlit Dashboard** for business users—no coding needed.  

### Engineering Highlights

- Modular data pipelines for preprocessing and training.  
- Automated testing with CI/CD integration.  
- Docker-ready for simplified deployment.

## 🔒 Relevance for Financial Services

Financial institutions often face a dilemma:

- **Simple models** = interpretable but less accurate.  
- **Complex models** = accurate but opaque.  

This project bridges that gap:

- **Logistic Regression** → For audit-ready, regulator-friendly insights.  
- **Random Forest** → For internal use, supported by explainability tools.

## 📊 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Processing**: Clean and enhance raw data with behavioral features.  
2. **Label Creation**: Derive proxy default labels via clustering and repayment history.  
3. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate models, saving the best-performing ones.  
4. **Deployment**: Host models through an API, ready for dashboard integration.  
5. **Interpretability**: Visual tools explain individual risk assessments.

## 🚀 What's Next

### Dashboard Development

- Launch a **Streamlit dashboard** with:  
  - Customer risk scores and SHAP visualizations.  
  - Filters and deep-dive features (by region, customer segment).  

### Scalable Deployment

- Connect backend (FastAPI) to the dashboard.  
- Containerize the system for seamless deployment.  
- Evaluate cloud deployment options (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  

### Model Monitoring

- Add tracking for **model drift** and performance degradation.  
- Build retraining workflows to adapt to new data.  

### Business Validation

- Simulate portfolio-level impacts (e.g., reduction in defaults).  
- Perform “what-if” scenarios to demonstrate business value.
